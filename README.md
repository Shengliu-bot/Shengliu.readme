I am a Master student at KIT in Germany. 
My research focuses on reaching Embodied Artificial Intelligence in humanoid robots to allow robots to navigate and manipulate objects safely in human-centered environments.
To achieve this, I train the robots interactively using reinforcement learning to be capable of seeing, hearing, language understanding, reasoning, planning, and decision making.
